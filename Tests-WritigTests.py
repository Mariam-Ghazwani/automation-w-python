# Unit tests
'''Unit tests are used to verify that small isolated parts of a program are correct.
Unit tests are generally written alongside the code to test the behavior of 
individual pieces or units like functions or methods. '''

# Edge Case
'''Edge cases are inputs to our code that produce unexpected results, and are found 
at the extreme ends of the ranges of input we imagine our programs will typically work with. 
Edge cases usually need special handling in scripts in order for the code to continue to behave correctly. '''
