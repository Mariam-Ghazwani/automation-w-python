We've aimed to make our Jupyter notebooks easy to use. But, if you get stuck, you can find more information [here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/360004995312-Solve-problems-with-Jupyter-Notebooks).

If you still need help, the discussion forums are a great place to find it! Use the forums to ask questions and source answers from your fellow learners.
